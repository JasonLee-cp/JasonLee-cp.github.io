```py
'''
Since the "richer" relationship always makes sense, it's an acyclic graph.

class Solution:
    def loudAndRich(self, richer: List[List[int]], quiet: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        n = len(quiet)
        adj = [[] for _ in range(n)]
        for rich, poor in richer:
            adj[poor].append(rich)
        answer = [None for _ in range(n)]
        reeturn map(self.dfs, adj, quiet, )
        for p in range(n):
            answer[p] = self.dfs(adj, quiet, answer, p)
        return answer

    def dfs(self, adj, quiet, answer, cur):
        if answer[cur]:
            return answer[cur]
        answer[cur] = cur
        for ngbr in adj[cur]:
            answer[cur] = min(answer[cur], self.dfs(adj, quiet, answer, ngbr), key=lambda p: quiet[p])
