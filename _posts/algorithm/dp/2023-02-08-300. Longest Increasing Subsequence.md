### 2D DP Solution

```py
class Solution:
    def lengthOfLIS(self, nums: List[int]) -> int:
        n = len(nums)
        res = 1
        dp = [1 for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(1, n):
            for j in range(0, i):
                if nums[i] > nums[j]:
                    dp[i] = max(dp[i], 1 + dp[j])
                    res = max(res, dp[i])

        return res
```
