## Link: [684. Redundant Connection](https://leetcode.com/problems/redundant-connection/)

We iterate through edges and determine if adding the current edge creates a cycle.

## Union Find (Path Compression, Union by Rank)

Tree is a **acyclic** graph with `E = V - 1`. Hence, we iterate each edge and see if adding that edge creates a cycle. We can do this by performing **Union Find** with disjoint sets. To further improve the performance, we can apply **path compression** and **union by rank**. Path compression restructures the tree(data structure to express disjoint sets) to minimize the volume. Union by rank is a method which assigns a `rank` to each "leader" so that the smaller tree will be merged into the larger tree.

```py
class DisjointSet:
    def __init__(self, n):
        self.parents = [_ for _ in range(n + 1)]
        self.ranks = [0 for _ in range(n + 1)]

    def find(self, i): # path compression
        if self.parents[i] != i:
            self.parents[i] = self.find(self.parents[i])
        return self.parents[i]

    def union(self, i, j):
        p_i, p_j = self.find(i), self.find(j)
        if p_i == p_j: # detected cycle
            return False
        if self.ranks[p_i] > self.ranks[p_j]: # Union by Rank
            self.parents[p_j] = p_i
        elif self.ranks[p_i] < self.ranks[p_j]:
            self.parents[p_i] = p_j
        else:
            self.parents[p_i] = p_j
            self.ranks[p_j] += 1
        return True


class Solution:
    def findRedundantConnection(self, edges: List[List[int]]) -> List[int]:
        ds = DisjointSet(len(edges))
        for edge in edges:
            if not ds.union(*edge):
                return edge
```

## DFS / BFS

As there cannot be multiple paths from `e1` to `e2` in a tree, we can perform DFS or BFS for each edge and see is there already exists a path from `e1` to `e2`.
