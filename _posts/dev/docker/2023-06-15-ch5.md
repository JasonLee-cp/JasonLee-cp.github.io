## Early Docker Architecture

![](/assets/img/temp/dockerch5_1.png)
When the Docker was first released, the Docker engine had two major components.

* Docker daemon
* LXC

Back then, the Docker daemon was a monolithic binary which means it contained all the code for API, runtime, image builds, etc. LXC was like a bridge that provided the daemon the access to the fundamental components of containers like namespaces and cgroups.

## Architecture Improvement

Docker. Inc. brought two major changes to the Docker Architecture.

1. Get rid of LXC
2. Get rid of monolithic Docker daemon

> Get rid of LXC

One problem of the earlier Docker architecture was that it relied on LXC which was Linux-specific. This was definitely a problem for a project aiming for multi-platform. Also, relying on an external tool for something so core to the project was a risk.

As a result, Docker. Inc. developed their own tool `libcontainer` to replace LXC. `libcontainer` is platform-agnostic tool and replaced LXC as the default **execution driver**.

> Get rid of monolithic Docker daemon

The monolithic architecture of the Docker daemon was a problem.

Docker, Inc. tried to break out as much functionality as possible from daemon and re-implement them in smaller specialized tools that could be swapped out and easily re-used to build other tools following Unix philosophy.

As a result, all of the container execution and container runtime code were entirely separated from the Docker daemon into small and specialized tools.

## Modern Docker Architecture

While Docker, Inc. was in development to break out the functionalities from the daemon, the **Open Container Initiative (OCI)** was working on to define container-related standards including

1. Image specification
2. Container runtime specification

Both specifications were released in July 2017 and All Docker versions since 2016 implement the OCI specifications. For example, the daemon does not contain any container runtime code but the runtime code is implemented in a separate OCI-compliant layer.

Now, let's dive into what each component does.

## `runc`
`runc` is the OCI container-runtime-spec implementation. It's a small and lightweight CLI wrapper for `libcontainer`.

The single purpose of `runc` is to <span style="background:#fff88f">create containers</span>. As it's a CLI wrapper, it's a standalone container runtime tool.

We sometimes say that `runc` operates at "the OCI layer".

## `containerd`
`containerd` contains all the container execution logic.

The sole purpose of `containerd` is to manage container lifecycle operations such as `start`, `stop`, `pause`, `rm`, etc.

## `shim`

The `shim` component is integral to the implementation of "daemonless" containers.

When `containerd` uses `runc` to create new containers, it actually forks a new instance of `runc` for every container it runs. However, once the container is created, the `runc` process exits.

Once a container's parent `runc` process exits, the `containerd-shim` process becomes the container's **parent** process. `shim` has responsibilities including

* Keeping any STDIN and STDOUT streams open so that when the daemon is restarted, the container doesn't terminate due to pipes closed
* Reports the container's exit status back to the daemon.

## `daemon`

The Docker daemon is capable of pushing and pulling images, implementing the Docker API, authentication, security, etc.

## Process of creating a new container
![](/assets/img/temp/dockerch5_3.png)

Let's go through what happens when we create a new container.

Suppose we run the following command

`docker run --name ctr1 -it alpine:latest sh`

First, the Docker client converts commands into the appropriate **API payload** and POSTs them to the API endpoint exposed by the Docker daemon.

The API is implemented in the daemon and is expoed over a local socket or the network. In Linux, the socket is `/var/run/docker.sock`.

When the daemon receives the command to create a new container, it calls `containerd`. Notice that the daemon does not create containers itself but it communicates with `containerd` through a CRUD-style API over gRPC.

However, `containerd` does NOT create containers itself but tells `runc` to do that. `containerd` converts the required Docker image into an OCI bundle and orders `runc` to use this to create a new container.

Then, `runc` interacts with the host OS kernel to create a container with all the constructs such as namespaces and cgroups.

The created container process is started as a child process of `runc`. However, remember that `runc` process exits as soon as the container starts.

## Advantage of decoupling from daemon

Separating all the code to start and manage containers from the Docker daemon brings a clear advantage.

As the entire container runtime is decoupled from the Docker daemon, we call this "daemonless containers".

In this architecture, we can perform maintenance and updates on the Docker daemon without influencing running containers.

In the early monolithic daemon architecture, starting and stopping the daemon would kill all running containers on the host.

## Implementation in Linux

In Linux system, the Docker components are implemented as separate binaries.

* `/usr/bin/dockerd` (daemon)
* `/usr/bin/containerd`
* `/usr/bin/containerd-shim-runc-v2`
* `/usr/bin/runc`
