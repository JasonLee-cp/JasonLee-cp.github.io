# Motivation

**VIZTA** is a <span style="background:#fff88f">visualization</span>-powered course evaluation service. It offers detailed, customized, and easy-to-grasp information about a course based on rich visualizations. VIZTA was developed aiming to overcome the drawbacks of traditional course evaluation services which are primarily based on <span style="background:#fff88f">comments</span> and limited visualizations, if any.

You probably have struggled to find the right courses to take during the add/drop period. In my university, there're only a few options to get information about courses. One option is to <span style="background:#fff88f">personally find friends who took the course before</span>. However, there're hundreds of courses for **common core courses** and **free electives** so often times I fail to find the person. Then what should I do? I google and try to see if there's any review. Yet, I found that the existing course evaluation services are not that trustworthy and convincing.

Let's see the problems of traditional course evaluation services.

# Problems of traditional course evaluation services

## 1. They're based on comments

| ![d](/assets/img/project/vizta2.png) |
| ------------------------------------ |
| Example of course evaluation website |

Most of traditional course evaluation services are based on <span style="background:#fff88f">student comments</span>. Some students just drop comments like,

1. `"Hey this course was aweful, never take it!"`
2. `"I got A+. If you follow along all lectures and work on assignments, you'll be in A range."`
3. `"Workload was pretty heavy but final exam was pretty doable"`

You've probably seen these type of comments before during add/drop period. However, the comments are very <span style="background:#fff88f">ineffective</span> to deliver information. Let's analyze them.

1. `"Hey this course was aweful, never take it!"`
   - How was it aweful? Was it aweful because you didn't get a good grade or the final exam was too difficult?
   - How did other classmates did? Did they feel the same way or was it only you?
2. `"I got A+. If you follow along all lectures and work on assignments, you'll be in A range."`
   - A+ is one of the important information that students want to see. Good!
   - But how much time-consuming and difficult was the assignment?
3. `"Workload was pretty heavy but final exam was pretty doable"`
   - Okay..I guess the lecture was okay. But what grade did you get at the end?

As you can see, there are <font color="#ff0000">serious flaws</font> in the comments-based course reviews.

> 1. Students are curious of a <span style="background:#fff88f">certain metrics</span> of course such as GPA, workload, or final exam difficulty.
> 2. Also, if shown in comments, students would have to go through one by one and <span style="background:#fff88f">process them and organize on their own</span> to establish a personal judgement of a course like "This class is too hard".
> 3. Finally, students usually search for many courses to draw out the best candidate. Reading through comments and processing them takes <span style="background:#fff88f">too much time and is very ineffective</span>.

## 2. They do not distinguish different years and professors

I've had many experiences that my friends recommended me some good courses(generous grade) for free electives for freshman and sophomore years but turned out that those courses are among my lowest grades on the transcript.

In some cases, the professor was the same but he or she changed the grade distribution(maybe he gave out too many A's in the previous semester) when I enrolled.

In the other case, the course had a different professor and the course was completely different in terms of grade distribution, workload, and final exam difficulty.

Therefore, when looking for courses, students must be able to see information for a specific year and professor.

## 3. Doesn't have clear evaluation metrics

Some students want to just take free A and some student look for high lecture quality so that they can learn something helpful for their careers.

Different students have different "criteria" when looking for courses but many of the traditional services rely on student comments, thus giving high degree of freedom with which students drop reviews.

# Solutions

## 1. Metric Visualization

![d](/assets/img/project/vizta1.png)

Overcoming the limitations of the comments-based course evaluation service, VIZTA provides a single-page dashboard with visualization for each metric.

There're a total of 5 metrics: <span style="background:#fff88f">GPA</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">Workload</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">Lecture Difficulty</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">Final Exam Difficulty</span>, and <span style="background:#fff88f">Leceture Quality</span>.

GPA, workload, and lecture/exam difficulty are visualized with bar charts to clearly deliver distributions of data for each criteria. The **badge**, average of all data, is attached for each criteria to deliver a catchy summary.

Lecture quality is further divided into "entertainment", "interactivity", and "delivery" and shown as a doughnut chart.

Finally, the **overall score** of all criteria is shown at the top right corner so that students can see the summarized evaluation of a course.

## 2. Distinguish different Year and Professor

![d](/assets/img/project/vizta3.png)

Users can select a specific <span style="background:#fff88f">year</span> and <span style="background:#fff88f">professor</span> to view more customized information.

The default option is the average of all years and professors. When user clicks on a specific year and professor, the dashboard changes accordingly.

When user selects only a year, then the professor data is equivalent to the average of all professors in that year and vice-versa.

## 3. Yearly Trend

![d](/assets/img/project/vizta4.png)

Suppose a professor who has been lenient for grading but suddenly highered A range cut-off or does not grade on curves starting from last year. In this case, students could see the yearly trend to get more intuition how the next semester will be.

VIZTA provides <span style="background:#fff88f">yearly trend</span> feature which allows users to see the yearly trend of each criteria for professors with a line chart. Users can also compare two or more professors.

## 4. Professor Statistics

![d](/assets/img/project/vizta5.png)

The other feature is the <span style="background:#fff88f">professor statistics</span> which allows students to compare different professors over a different range of metrics.

With this feature, students can more intuitively select a more appropriate professor based on his or her personal preferences.

## 5. General Information

![d](/assets/img/project/vizta6.png)

Students could also find general information such as <span style="background:#fff88f">department</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">prerequisites</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">mutual exclusive courses</span>, <span style="background:#fff88f">time table</span>, and <span style="background:#fff88f">grading ratio</span>

Grading ratio might be different for professors. Hence, students can select a professor to see the specific grading ratio. By default, the most recent grading ratio for each professor is shown.

When I was working on <span style="background:#fff88f">storing prerequisites in database</span>, I encountered a challenge which is to store <span style="background:#fff88f">complex prerequisite relationship</span> in relational data base.

For example, the Machine Learning course has prerequisite requirements as

`(COMP2119 or ELEC2543 or FITE2000) and (MATH1853 or MATH2014)`

which means you have to take least one of the COMP2119, ELECT2543, and FITE200 and you also have to take one of MATH1853 and MATH2014.

It was quite challenging to store this type of data connected with conjunctions and disjunctions. If you want to see more about how to store complex prerequisites, check out my post
